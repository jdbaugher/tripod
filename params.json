It has been shown to provide improved \r\nsensitivity for abnormality detection, with substantial improvement in \r\ndetection of low-level mosaic abnormalities, as described in \r\n[Baugher JD, et al.

See [Baugher JD, et al.](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/14/367/) \r\n  for explanations of rate and probability calculations. The \r\n  following information is included for each trio: \r\n  file name, trio member names, NoCall rates, \r\n  nonadjacent homozygous deletion (HD) and single\r\n\tMendelian error (MI1) rates, minimum region sizes, calculated\r\n\tMI1 BAF thresholds, initial and corrected alpha values for FDR\r\n\tcontrol, estimated error rate, acceptable errors for POD\r\n\tregion extension, global BAF thresholds for detecting\r\n\tinformative SNPs, counts of regions detected by each detection\r\n\tmethod.  \r\n\t\r\n  - ./log_files/*triPOD_log.txt \r\n\t\r\n  STDERR is redirected to a log file.  \r\n\t\r\n  - *.png and/or *.pdf\r\n  \r\n\tOptional graphical output is generated for each chromosome \r\n\tharboring an abnormality. The upper panel is a plot of the log \r\n\tR ratio (LRR) values with the LRR moving average plotted in green\r\n\tand a black horizontal line at y=0 to assist with visualization of\r\n\tcopy number changes. The center panel is a plot of the B allele \r\n\tfrequency (BAF), in which abnormalities can frequently be \r\n\tvisualized as splitting of the heterozygous (center) BAF band. The \r\n\tlower panel is a plot of the abnormalities detected by triPOD. \r\n\tAbnormalities with known parental origin or contribution are \r\n\tplotted adjacent to the Father and Mother axis labels. \r\n\tAbnormalities with unknown contribution or abnormal contribution \r\n\tfrom both parents are plotted along the y=0.5 axis, between the \r\n\tFather and Mother labels. The types of abnormalities are color \r\n\tcoded as follows: red = deletion, blue = amplification, gray = \r\n\thomozygous deletion, purple = uniparental heterodisomy, green = \r\n\tuniparental isodisomy, and black = all other abnormalities for \r\n\twhich a type cannot be assigned (including low-level mosaic \r\n\tevents of all types). \r\n\r\n### Additional Considerations\r\n\r\n  - Care should be taken when interpreting large abnormalities in \r\n  commonly variable regions due to a tendency to combine small \r\n  adjacent abnormalities of the same type.\r\n  \r\n  - Interesting findings should be graphically investigated until \r\n  the user has gained expertise with the strengths and weaknesses \r\n  of the various detection and annotation methods employed by triPOD. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
